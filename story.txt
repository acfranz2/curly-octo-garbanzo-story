It was a cold, windy sunday afternoon in UW-Madison's lakeshore dorms. Braeden still lied asleep in bed, snoring. 
He began to stir as the sounds of birds chirping filled his dreams. Suddenly he fumbled for his phone as the 
chirping became more volatile. Sitting up for a moment he glanced around the room to notice that his roommate was 
already out of the room. He lied down again for a moment, then began his day. He hopped out of bed, threw on some 
close, and grabbed his overnight oats. While eating over his dresser, he stared at his phone checking messages, 
playing games, and watching videos. Afterwards he grabbed his bag, zipped up his heavy winter coat, and headed to 
Kronshage to study with his friends and potentially bake some brownies.

Max:
On his way out of the dorm he realized that the chirping he was hearing was actually his roomate perched on the window,
screaming his lungs out. Braeden was a little creeped out by this but he continued outside. He began to 
run to see his friends. He was so excited to bake some brownies, but suddenly he felt his tummy ache. Did his roommate
poison him?

Lucas:
Braedon got out the door of his dorm when he realized something was off. It was almost completely dark outside. 
He checked his phone to make sure he had the right time. It was 9:00... PM! Braedon had set an alarm 12 hours off and had managed to sleep the entire day. 

Megan:
So, not only did Braedon sleep throughout the whole day, he was also sick!!! Braedon spent the next 12 hours of the night 
vomiting as he had the stomach flu. Braedon was dissapointed his brownie baking would have to be postponed until further
notice. Two weeks later, Breadon went to the hostpital because his roommate continued to poision him! What will Breadon 
do next?
