It was a cold, windy sunday afternoon in UW-Madison's lakeshore dorms. Braeden still lied asleep in bed, snoring. He began to stir as the sounds of birds chirping filled his dreams. Suddenly he fumbled for his phone as the chirping became more volatile. Sitting up for a moment he glanced around the room to notice that his roommate was already out of the room. He lied down again for a moment, then began his day. He hopped out of bed, threw on some close, and grabbed his overnight oats. While eating over his dresser, he stared at his phone checking messages, playing games, and watching videos. Afterwards he grabbed his bag, zipped up his heavy winter coat, and headed to Kronshage to study with his friends and potentially bake some brownies.
